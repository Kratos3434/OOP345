I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I have learned how to implement the move constructor and the move 
assignment operator. The move assignment and move constructor is somewhat similar to the copy 
constructor and copy assignment operator, but the difference is that the data in the object that we want 
to move is moved to the current object or in simple term we are moving the ownership of the object to 
the current object instead of just copying the data from the object hence the name ‘Move’, an example 
of move constructor and move assignment from the workshop: 

TennisLog::TennisLog(TennisLog&& tl) { 

	  *this = std::move(tl); 

    } 

    TennisLog& TennisLog::operator=(TennisLog&& tl) { 

	  if (this != &tl) { 

		delete[] m_tennisMatch; 

  

		NOM = tl.NOM; 

  

		m_tennisMatch = tl.m_tennisMatch; 

		tl.NOM = 0;
		tl.m_tennisMatch = nullptr; 

	  } 

  

	  return *this; 

    } 

 The difficulties I have faced during the workshop is that I doubted my capabilities or my knowledge 
because when I debugged it is giving me a weird output so I thought that there was a gap in my 
knowledge, but it turns out that when I submitted out of desperation my functions were right or my 
implementations. Maybe it was giving me a weird output because the file is too big. I also learned briefly 
about std::chrono on how to calculate the duration of a function.
